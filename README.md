# Lil-Youtube
A simple web application that i made in my 6th semester of engineering. This application interacts with the Youtube API and fetches the search results according to the search query provided by the user and displays them to the user.
The purpose of making this application was to learn and understand how to interact with an API.

## What i learned: 
- How to interact with an API
- How to read and manipulate JSON files
- How to dynamically build the UI elements
